# picasso-site
A sample portfolio website for Pablo Ruiz Picasso.<br>
Still a work-in-progress.<br>
Wanted to design a minimalist, clean interface website.<br>
Animations were done using animation.css.<br>
Website was inspired by Jen Bayne's site.<br>
Please note that the site won't work well on mobiles, as it hasn't been optimized for that yet.
