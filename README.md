# picasso-site
A sample portfolio website for Pablo Ruiz Picasso
Still a work-in-progress.
Wanted to design a minimalist, clean interface website.
Animations were done using animation.css.
Website was inspired by Jen Bayne's site.
Please note that the site won't work well on mobiles, as it hasn't been optimized for that yet.
